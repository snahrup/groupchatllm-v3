- Verify all error states and edge cases
- Test with API rate limits and failures

## üîß Recent Major Changes (This Session)

### Frontend Enhancements
1. **Message Display Fix**:
   - Enhanced getModelIcon/getModelName to handle UUIDs
   - Fixed message processing effect with better completion detection
   - Added proper data attributes for synapse targeting
   - Improved streaming to conversation conversion logic

2. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - SynapseAnimation component with SVG line animations
   - ModelThinkingIndicator with bouncing dot animations
   - Enhanced message styling with character counts
   - Auto-scrolling with smooth behavior

3. **Audio Feedback**:
   - Complete sound effects system (SoundEffects class)
   - Subtle tones for model events and collaboration
   - User toggle for sound on/off
   - Chord progressions for synapse detection

4. **Debug Improvements**:
   - Comprehensive test interface artifact
   - Enhanced logging throughout message flow
   - Better error handling and state tracking

### New Components Created
- `SynapseAnimation.tsx` - Visual collaboration lines
- `ModelThinkingIndicator.tsx` - Elegant loading states
- `soundEffects.ts` - Audio feedback system
- Test interface artifact for debugging

### Architecture Decisions
- Model IDs remain UUIDs (backend design maintained)
- Frontend handles UUID to friendly name mapping gracefully
- Sound effects are optional and user-controllable
- Synapse animations use SVG for smooth performance
- Data attributes enable precise element targeting

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Environment

### Current Setup
- **OS**: Windows (C:\Users\steve\CascadeProjects\groupchatllm-v3)
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 with virtual environment at `.venv`
- **Frontend**: Node.js with Vite dev server
- **Launch**: Use `launch.bat` or `launch.ps1` for both services

### Active Configurations
- **API Keys**: Configured in `backend/.env`
  - OpenAI: ‚úÖ Active
  - Anthropic: ‚úÖ Active
  - Google: ‚ö†Ô∏è Quota exceeded (free tier)
- **Ports**: 
  - Backend: 8000
  - Frontend: 5173
- **Auto-reload**: Enabled for both services

## üìù Notes for Next Developer

### Known Status
1. **Message Display**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Messages now render properly
2. **Model Names**: ‚úÖ FIXED - Frontend handles both UUIDs and friendly names
3. **Synapse Animations**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Visual collaboration feedback ready
4. **Sound Effects**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Subtle audio feedback with user control

### Key Features Added
1. **Comprehensive Test Interface**: Artifact created for debugging SSE and API
2. **Visual Collaboration**: Synapse lines animate between collaborating models
3. **Audio Feedback**: Subtle sound effects for all interaction events
4. **Enhanced Loading States**: Elegant thinking indicators with animations
5. **Auto-scrolling**: Smooth conversation flow management

### Testing Quick Start
1. Use launch.ps1 to start both services
2. Frontend has default mission/message text - just click Send
3. Watch for synapse animations when models collaborate
4. Toggle sound effects with üîä/üîá button in header
5. Use test interface artifact for debugging specific issues

### Performance Notes
- Synapse animations are optimized for 60fps
